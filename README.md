<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
There are many great great ideas on Netflix and Yelp clone, but I could not find one that brings both worlds together or really suit my insterest so I created one.

Please!!!
 Do not hesitate to give suggestions on how this application can be improved. I look forward to hearing from you.
